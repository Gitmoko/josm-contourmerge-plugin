README 
======

The 'contourmerge' plugin provides an editing mode to merge (or align) two contours on an OSM map, i.e.
 - a section of a lake outline and an a section of neighboring area representing a forest
 - a section of a coast line and a section of a residential area
 - two border sections
 etc. 
 
BUILD 
=====
- copy 'build.properties.distrib' to 'build.properties' and adjust the build configuration
  settings

- run ant in the root directory
    % ant dist
    
DEPLOY
======
The latest build for the 'contourmerge' plugin should always be built on the branch 'deploy'
and the pushed to GitHub.

There is a special branch 'deploy' for deploying.   
  % git checkout deploy
  % git merge master          # merge the development work from the branch 'master'
  % ant dist                  # this creates dist/contourmerge.jar which is part
                              # of the Git tree under this branch
  % git push origin deploy    # Pushes the latest build to git hub  

If the build requires a minimal JOSM version, i.e. JOSM 1234, then execute the following
steps:
 1. Make sure build.xml includes a line 
     <attribute name="1234-Plugin-Url" value="9876;http://github.com/Gubaer/josm-contourmerge-plugin/blob/for-josm-1234/dist/contourmerge.jar?raw=true" />
     where
       1234   is the required JOSM version
       9876   is the plugin version. You should have assigned it in 'build.properties'
  
 2. % ant dist                      # crates the contourmerge.jar, dependency specifications 
                                    # become part of the Manifest in the plugin
                             
    % git push origin deploy        # push the jar to Git Hub
    % git tag for-josm-1234  HEAD   # tag the latest commit 
    % git push origin for-josm-1234 # makes sure the latest build is tagged with 'for-josm-1234'
    
This ensure, that the latest contourmerge plugin is available from 
    <http://github.com/Gubaer/josm-contourmerge-plugin/blob/deploy/dist/contourmerge.jar?raw=true>
    
The contourmerge plugin requiring JOSM 1234 is available from
    <http://github.com/Gubaer/josm-contourmerge-plugin/blob/for-josm-4223/dist/contourmerge.jar?raw=true>
